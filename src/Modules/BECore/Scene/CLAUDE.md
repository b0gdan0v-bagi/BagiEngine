# Scene Module Guidelines

## Overview

Scene graph on top of EnTT: `SceneManager` → `Scene` → `SceneNode` → `IComponent`. Everything is reflected and loaded from `config/SceneConfig.xml`, so the scene editor and the file stay in sync (`.claude/rules/widgets-module.md`).

| Class | Role |
|-------|------|
| `SceneManager` | Built with `MakeFromConfig<SceneManager>("SceneConfig")` in `CoreManager::OnApplicationInit`. Holds `_scenes`; the first one is active after `Initialize()`. `SetActiveScene(name)`, `GetActiveScene()`, `GetSceneByName()`; `UpdateAll()` / `DrawAll()` drive the active scene. It is the only writer of `Scene::IsActive()` |
| `Scene` | `FACTORY_BASE`. Owns the `entt::registry`, a runtime root node (`"Root"`) and the serialized `_nodes`. `Update()` emits `SceneEvents::SceneFixedUpdateEvent` once per fixed step due in the frame, then `SceneUpdateEvent` with the frame time (both read `CoreManager::GetTime()`); `Draw()` emits `SceneDrawEvent`. `IsActive()` is true for the scene `SceneManager` currently drives. `PrepareForSave()` copies the live hierarchy back into `_nodes` (the scene editor calls it before saving) |
| `SceneNode` | `FACTORY_BASE`, XML element `node`: `_name`, `_components`, children, an `entt::entity`. `AddComponent`, `RemoveComponent`, `GetComponent<T>()`, `AddChild` |
| `IComponent` | `FACTORY_BASE` and `SubscriptionHolder`; gets its `Scene&` / `SceneNode&` through `GetScene()` / `GetNode()` |

## XML shape

```xml
<SceneManager><scenes>
  <scene type="Scene" name="MainScene"><nodes>
    <node name="YellowQuad"><components>
      <component type="TransformComponent" x="167.3" y="107.7" width="42.5" height="71.7"/>
      <component type="QuadRendererComponent"><color r="255" g="255" b="0" a="255"/></component>
    </components></node>
  </nodes></scene>
</scenes></SceneManager>
```

`type` is the component class name; field names lose the leading underscore. Every `SceneConfig.xml` replaces the one below it in the content layers (see `FileSystem/CLAUDE.md`): the engine's own file holds a debug `MainScene`, and a game's file holds only that game's scenes, so a game executable never loads `MainScene`.

## Component lifecycle

1. Deserialization creates the component through `AbstractFactory<IComponent>` and calls `Initialize()` (the reflection hook: runs even when there is no node yet).
2. `Scene::Initialize()` → `SceneNode::WireToScene()` sets `_scene` / `_node` and calls `OnAttached()`. `AddComponent` does the same at runtime.
3. Do node-dependent setup in `OnAttached()`: event subscriptions, resource lookups, sibling components via `GetNode().GetComponent<T>()`. This runs for the components of **every** loaded scene, active or not, so subscribe with `SubscribeInScene` (see Gotchas).

## Built-in components (`Components/`)

| Component | Fields | Behavior |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| `TransformComponent` | `_x`, `_y`, `_width`, `_height` | Position/size in screen pixels; others read it |
| `QuadRendererComponent` | `_color` | Draws a filled rect at the node's transform on `SceneDrawEvent` |
| `SpriteRendererComponent` | `_spriteId`, `_texturePath`, `_srcRect` | Draws a texture; `_spriteId` resolves through `TextureLibrary` |
| `ClickableComponent` | `_actionName` | On mouse-down inside the transform rect, emits `InputEvents::ActionEvent(_actionName)` |
| `ChangeToRandomColorDebugComponent` | `_actionFilter` | Debug: recolors the node's quad on a matching action |

## Adding a component

1. Class in `Components/` (or a game module's `Components/`) deriving `IComponent` with `BE_CLASS(Name)`; fields get `BE_REFLECT_FIELD`.
2. Include `<Generated/Name.gen.hpp>` in its `.cpp`; the directory must be in `reflection_targets.json`; re-run `cmake --preset ...`.
3. Subscribe in `OnAttached()` through `SubscribeInScene<Event, &Name::Handler>(this)`. Plain `Subscribe` is only for a handler that must run whichever scene is active.
4. Use it from `config/SceneConfig.xml` with `type="Name"`. The inspector shows its reflected fields automatically.

## Gotchas

- `SceneUpdateEvent` / `SceneDrawEvent` and the input events (`SDLEvents::MouseButtonDownEvent`, `InputEvents::ActionEvent`) are **global** `EventBase` events, not per scene, and `OnAttached()` runs for the components of **every** scene when the config loads. Subscribe with `IComponent::SubscribeInScene<Event, &Handler>(this)`: the handler is called only while the component's scene is active (`Scene::IsActive()`, set by `SceneManager`). Plain `Subscribe` on such an event makes a component of an inactive scene draw, click and react. The filter sits in the call, the connection stays, so switching scenes never connects or disconnects anything (which is not allowed inside a handler).
- A game's own state is a separate check: Chess components also do nothing unless `GameManager::GetActive()` is `ChessGame`, because they read the shared model from there.
- `tests/BECore/SceneEventsTest.cpp` loads two scenes from an XML string and shows how to test a component without a window or a renderer. Use the same setup for a new component.
- Do not keep `SceneNode*` / `IComponent*` across scene edits; hold `IntrusivePtr` or look the node up again.
- Do not draw from `Update` or change state from `Draw`; the frame order and the use of `deltaTime` are in `BECore/CLAUDE.md`. Movement and animation scale by `SceneUpdateEvent::deltaTime`.
