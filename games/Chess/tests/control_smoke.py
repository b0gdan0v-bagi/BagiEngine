"""Smoke test of the control API for Chess: starts BagiChess with --control and plays over WebSocket.

    python games/Chess/tests/control_smoke.py --exe build/ClangmacOS/BagiChess

ctest runs it as BagiChessControlSmoke (be_add_game_control_tests). It builds on the engine's tools/control/tests/smoke.py,
which it finds through the environment variable BAGI_ENGINE_DIR (set by ctest), or next to this repository (engine/ when Chess
sits in its own repository, the repository root when it sits in games/). The game is played twice, on the real clock and with
--manual-clock. Exit code: 0 passed, 1 failed, 77 skipped (the executable does not exist).
